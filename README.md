# 💰 ATM Simulation System (Java)

A simple **console-based ATM simulation system** built in **Java** using **OOP concepts** and **File Handling**.  
This project demonstrates how an ATM interacts with user accounts — performing basic banking operations like login, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal.
